# imanagestuff

This application was generated using JHipster 6.10.3 and JHipster Quarkus 0.1.6, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.10.3](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.10.3).

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./gradlew -x webpack
    npm start

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

#### How to add new entity or change exist entity

switch to branch jhipster
describe you changes in imange.jh

- regenerate application with

  jhipster import-jdl --skip-db-changelog imanage.jh

- commit changes
- switch to yours feature branch
- merge changes from jhipster
- generate diff changelog
  - start application, this will create database with current scheme
  - stop application
  - run command `./gradlew liquibaseDiffChangelog`
  - changelog file will be generated under `resources/config/liquibase/changelog`
  - check content of generated file
  - add the file to `resources/config/liquibase/master.xml`
  - lunch application and check all is working fine
- push changes

### PWA Support

JHipster ships with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and it's turned off by default. One of the main components of a PWA is a service worker.

The service worker initialization code is commented out by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in `src/main/webapp/index.html`:

```html
<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('./service-worker.js').then(function () {
      console.log('Service Worker Registered');
    });
  }
</script>
```

Note: [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) powers JHipster's service worker. It dynamically generates the `service-worker.js` file.

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    npm install --save --save-exact leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    npm install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
Note: There are still a few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

## Building for production

### Packaging as thin jar

To build the final jar and optimize the imanagestuff application for production, run:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean bootJar
```

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.jar

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as native executable

_Targeting your Operation System_
In order to build a native image locally, your need to have [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) installed and `GRAALVM_HOME` defined.
You can use the `native` profile as follow to build native executable.

```
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native.
```

Keep in mind that the generated native executable is dependent on your Operating System.

_Targeting a container environment_
If you plan to run your application in a container, run:

```
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

It will use a Docker container with GraalVM installed and produce an 64 bit Linux executable.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test integrationTest jacocoTestReport

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    npm test

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down
